- 👋 Hi, I’m @Martin-Rose
- 👀 I’m interested in learning front-end developer skills, creating a project portfolio, and collaborating on some beginner/intermediate level projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS on FreeCodeAcademy.  I have been going at it now for 1 month about 2-6 hours per day.  I have completed my first two projects required for the certification.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything.  It could be a new beginner project and maybe even a little bit beyond that to push me to learn and expand my knowledge.
- 📫 How to reach me:  Comment on here maybe?  Not sure what information to put on here as far as email/linkedin goes.  My linkedin is on my profile so you could add me there!  Hope to hear from someone soon!
